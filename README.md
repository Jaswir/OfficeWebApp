# Office Web App

### Description
Backend portfolio project that displays all my backend experience in just 1 project:

* Authentication and Authorization
* CRUD / REST API
* Microservices

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)  docker in your environment. After that, you can run the below commands from the **/OfficeWebApp/** directory and get started with the `OfficeWebApp` immediately.

```powershell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
